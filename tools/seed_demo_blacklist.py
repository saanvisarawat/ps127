"""
Seeds the blacklist table with FICTIONAL demo entries for the Alerts screen.

These are NOT real vehicles, owners, or enforcement records. Plate numbers use
real, currently-valid Delhi RTO zone-code prefixes (DL01-DL14, verified against
the Delhi Transport Department's own zonal-office list at
https://transport.delhi.gov.in/transport/zonal-offices as of 2026) followed by
a fictional series letter pair and 4-digit number, so they look authentic in a
demo without corresponding to any real, currently-issued registration. Series
letters/numbers were deliberately chosen not to overlap with any plate used in
this project's own self-captured/simulated traffic data (e.g. DL01AB1234,
DL05ZZ9999).

A future task may add real-time Delhi RTO-code *validation* against this same
verified code list (rejecting malformed plates); that is deferred and not
implemented here.
