"""
Manually-curated snapshot of PUBLIC, city-wide Delhi vehicle-registration
statistics, for display alongside (never mixed into) this platform's own
live ANPR numbers.

This is NOT a live feed and does not call Parivahan/Vahan at request time —
that portal is a session-based JSF application not meant for programmatic
scraping. Instead, this snapshot is taken directly from the Government of
NCT of Delhi's own published "Economic Survey of Delhi 2025-26" (Transport
chapter, Statement 12.11/12.12), the same kind of aggregate report the Vahan
public dashboard itself is built from. No per-vehicle or per-owner data is
involved anywhere — only a handful of city-wide totals.

Update this dict by hand when a newer Economic Survey of Delhi is published
(typically annually, around the Delhi Budget session in March).

Separate historical dataset — deliberately NOT merged with the snapshot above.

Source: "Delhi Total Number of Vehicles 2015-16 to 2024-25", published via
portal.delhi.gov.in and hosted on OpenCity (Oorvani Foundation):
https://data.opencity.in/dataset/delhi-vehicle-registrations-data

Its FY2024-25 total (84,13,644 "vehicles plying") does NOT match the Economic
Survey's FY2024-25 figure (81,18,294) above — a ~3.5% gap, most likely from
different snapshot dates / "plying" vs "on-road" methodology. Rather than
splice the two into one continuous series (which would imply false precision),
this is kept as its own dataset with its own citation.

The sharp drop between 2020-21 and 2021-22 in this data lines up with the
age-based deregistration drive (diesel >10yr / petrol >15yr) referenced in
the Economic Survey — not a data error.
